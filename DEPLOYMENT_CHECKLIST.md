### 10. Documentation and Backup
- [ ] Document deployment process for team
- [ ] Create backup of Firebase data
- [ ] Document admin procedures
- [ ] Set up regular backup schedule

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Firebase Issues
- **Connection errors**: Check API keys and project ID
- **Authentication fails**: Verify domain in authorized domains
- **Permission denied**: Check Firestore security rules
- **Admin access denied**: Verify email in `ALLOWED_ADMIN_EMAILS`

### Netlify Issues
- **Build fails**: Check build logs in Netlify dashboard
- **404 errors**: Verify `netlify.toml` redirects
- **Assets not loading**: Check file paths and case sensitivity
- **Custom domain issues**: Verify DNS configuration

### Performance Issues
- **Slow loading**: Optimize images and enable compression
- **Large bundle size**: Review and minimize JavaScript
- **Poor mobile performance**: Check responsive design

## Emergency Rollback

If deployment fails:
1. [ ] Check Netlify deployment logs
2. [ ] Revert to previous deployment in Netlify dashboard
3. [ ] Fix issues locally
4. [ ] Re-run validation: `npm run validate`
5. [ ] Deploy again

## Success Criteria

âœ… **Deployment is successful when:**
- Site loads correctly at your domain
- All blog posts are accessible
- Admin panel works with Google authentication
- Posts can be created and edited
- Firebase integration is working
- Mobile site is responsive
- HTTPS is enabled
